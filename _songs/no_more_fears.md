Started out with everything, this new era of all or nothing, made me so crazy\
Still here, still fear, still can hear the new year that’s over there, oh my dear\
School, jobs, world tour, surfing the shore are you sure\
Give me more, what’s our cure for the poor?\
\
No more fears\
No more fears, no more fears\
Oh my dear, come over your fears of the year\
We’re getting near, oh my dear\
\
Australia, New Zealand, Paris, New York, London and Rome, home, home\
Australia, New Zealand, Paris, New York, London and Rome, home, home\
Australia, New Zealand and Thailand, the classics of our dreams\
Paris, New York, London and Rome, some day, hope it’ll be our home\
Australia, New Zealand and Thailand, the classics of our dreams\
Paris, New York, London and Rome, some day, hope it’ll be our home\
Our home, our home, our home, no more fears\
\
No more fears\
No more fears, no more fears\
Oh my dear, come over your fears of the year\
We’re getting near, oh my dear\
\
No more fears, no more fears\
No more fears, no more fears\
For the next years that will try to bring us down
