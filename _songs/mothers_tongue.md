title: Mother's Tongue
---

"Wanna go up north, to see the sun The midnight sun Wanna go up north, to talk their tongue Their mother’s tongue ’Cause we’re all going back in time We’re all going back in time We’re all going back in time We’re all going back in time Wanna get out there, to be free No pipelines wherever to be seen Wanna go down south, to feel so real No walls can ever stop me ’Cause we’re all going back in time We’re all going back in time We’re all going back in time We’re all going back in time Wanna go up north, to see the sun The midnight sun Wanna go up north, to talk their tongue Their mother’s tongue
