Wanna go up north, to see the sun\
The midnight sun\
Wanna go up north, to talk their tongue\
Their mother’s tongue\
\
’Cause we’re all going back in time\
We’re all going back in time\
We’re all going back in time\
We’re all going back in time\
\
Wanna get out there, to be free\
No pipelines wherever to be seen\
Wanna go down south, to feel so real\
No walls can ever stop me\
\
’Cause we’re all going back in time\
We’re all going back in time\
We’re all going back in time\
We’re all going back in time\
\
Wanna go up north, to see the sun\
The midnight sun\
Wanna go up north, to talk their tongue\
Their mother’s tongue\
