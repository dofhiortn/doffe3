title: Where The East Coast Ends
---

I’m where the east coast ends, you can find me here
Between sea and sands, that’s where the east coast ends
I’m climbing with my hands and watching all the views
And learning Catalan, I’m where the east coast ends

You are there I am here

Where the east coast ends,
I’m here with my new friends
Where the east coast ends, but we’re from different lands
Where the east coast ends, and we’re creating new bands
Where the east coast ends, flamenco and salsa dance

I’m where the east coast ends, you can find me here
Between sea and sands, that’s where the east coast ends
I’m climbing with my hands and watching all the views
And learning Catalan, I’m where the east coast I’m where the east coast ends

You are there I’m still here
Where the east coast ends, you can find me here
