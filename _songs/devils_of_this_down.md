title: Devils (Of This Town)
---

"Spoken French all day I despise, but I’ve spoken it anyway
What did they say? Ensemble, solo
Finnish and Hungarian they are the same
’Cause we’re all the same

We’re the devils of this town
We’re the devils of this time around
We’re the devils of this town
No one speaks our tongue anymore I’m Lucifer, you’re Beelzebub
And we’re devils of this town

Nice in Nice, only in Lyon Little Paris, the only thing we know
Parks and squares, the lake and the mountains two
Love me like you did in Venice and you are not going to Damaskus, Damaskus
We’re the devils of this town We’re the devils of this time around

We’re the devils of this town
No one speaks our tongue anymore, anymore
If you want us, you can have us
But first you have to beat us in our own game
Approximate a thousand times, just to get us down
But who cares for the unreal men of brothers?

We’re the devils of this town
We’re the forgotten sons of this forbidden town
We’re the devils of this time around
We’re the devils of this town
No one speaks our tongue anymore I’m Lucifer, you’re Beelzebub
