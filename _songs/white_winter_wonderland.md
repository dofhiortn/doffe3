title: White Winter Wonderland
---

"I’m not in control now Your train stuck in snow now My mother, she’s making dough now But my father don’t know Why she’s doing that But she loves it, Even if I’m not there To decorate the house My sister, she’s eating pepper cookies Manfred, he’s eating Lucifer cats My old and sick grandma, she’s making Jansson's temptation I’m fifteen above zero And your train’s still stuck in snow In a white winter wonderland But my father don’t know Why she’s doing that But she loves it Even if I’m not there To decorate the house
