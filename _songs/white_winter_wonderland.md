I’m not in control now\
Your train stuck in snow now\
My mother, she’s making dough now\
But my father don’t know\
\
Why she’s doing that\
But she loves it,\
Even if I’m not there\
To decorate the house\
\
My sister, she’s eating pepper cookies\
Manfred, he’s eating Lucifer cats\
My old and sick grandma, she’s making Jansson's temptation\
\
I’m fifteen above zero\
And your train’s still stuck in snow\
In a white winter wonderland\
\
But my father don’t know\
Why she’s doing that\
But she loves it\
Even if I’m not there\
To decorate the house
