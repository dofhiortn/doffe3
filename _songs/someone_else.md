title: Someone Else
---

"We used to hold each other’s hands We wrote our names in the sands When the time and tide took it all away You weren’t there to stay Now your love has gone with someone else I used to be that someone else I drove Corolla and bought clothes from second hand Well, he was the king of the Promised Land I really do understand why didn’t take my hand I thought our love was, oh, so very true You never saw us as ”me and you” Now your love has gone with someone else I used to be that someone else I thought our love was, oh, so very true You never saw us as ”me and you” Now your love has gone with someone else I used to be that someone else I used to be that someone else Well, I thought I used to be that someone else
