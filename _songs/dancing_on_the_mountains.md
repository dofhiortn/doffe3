We were barefoot in the streets, we were sleeping on the beach\
We were kings and queens of sorrow, and we never thought about tomorrow

We were skating on the ice, I was drowning in her eyes\
We were freezing in the snow, and we never thought about where to go

I was scared, almost dead\
When dancing on the mountains with you\
I was down, but you took me high\
When dancing on the mountains with you\
Open up, Michelle, ’cause your home is my home as well

You were leaving with the train, you were leaving the great lake’s rain\
I went following on the E45 highway\
Ten thousand miles away in Seattle or in outer space\
The winter sun woke me up for some brighter days\
I read books rarely, but I often went to libraries\
You loved the temporary part at contemporary art galleries

You were long gone, I looked so dumb\
When dreaming of the mountains with you\
I was high, but now I’m down\
When dreaming of the mountains with you\
Still wondering why I left my hometown\
’Cause your blooming heart keeps my wheels spinning around

Put your heart in my loving arms\
And your breasts against my chest\
Your heart will bloom in the loving gloom\
And the winter keeps us near in this damp room

Put your heart in my loving arm\
And your breasts against my chest\
Your heart will bloom in the loving gloom\
And the winter keeps us near in this damp room\
And only God can know when the sun will thaw the snow
