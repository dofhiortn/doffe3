title: Super Market
---

"Met you outside the post office that morning I was in a rush I asked you out for a beer But I said that I had no time You were all about yourself You had to send a mail For a long forgotten friend That used to share your bed Are you gonna come my way, or are you gonna play the game? Are you gonna come my way, ’cause you know I’m on sale? You can dive for my heart in a dumpster ’cause I threw it away, it away, it away You can die for my heart ’cause I threw it away the other day, other day, other day Met you inside the gas station that morning, you were about to leave I asked for your ID, 'cause you looked so young, you wanted smokes Then you asked me back; ""Why would I stay? Please, come with me away” Are you gonna come way or are you gonna stay the same? Are you gonna come my way, ’cause you know I’m on sale? You can dive for my heart in a dumpster ’cause I threw it away, it away, it away You can die for my heart ’cause I threw it away the other day, other day Come enter with me, follow your note at the market, super market Come follow with me, enter the line at the market, super market Come enter with me, follow your note at the market, super market Come follow with me, enter the line at the market, super market Are you gonna come way or are you gonna stay the same? Are you gonna come my way, ’cause you know I’m on sale? You can dive for my heart in a dumpster ’cause I threw it away, it away, it away You can die for my heart ’cause I threw it away the other day, other day
