title: Leave Town
---


I wanna leave this rain, I wanna go to Spain Someone’s going nowhere, another one’s going to Norway Someone’s starting university in a far-away city But none of us is a pity, it’s all about diversity Leave town when you’re down and come back when you’re done Leave town when you’re down and come back when you’re done Now I’m returning back home, but I don’t wanna be left alone Sailing away from my Iberica, crossing ocean for South America Buy a flat in the center of Paris, or is it all just hybris Gonna stay there for a while or will it end up as a life time? Leave town when you’re down and come back when you’re done Leave town when you’re down and come back when you’re done Leave town when you’re down and come back when you’re done Leave town when you’re down and come back when you’re done Wake up, wake up, wake up from your absence and come home Wake up, wake up, wake up from your absence and come back home Leave town when you’re down and come back when you’re done Leave town when you’re down and come back when you’re done
