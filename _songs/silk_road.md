"You travel the Silk Road I’m still stuck in my boy’s room Now you’re going away But I hope that you’ll still stay my best friend You’re leaving our continent I hope that you’ll be content I’m just looking for an apartment ’Cause your room in my heart is not for rent I will take care of you Even though you’re on the other side of the world When you wake up I go to bed But I know that you’ll come home again You and your East India I’m still stuck here in this west coast indie night I hope that you’ll be alright Then I might leave you out of my sight I will take care of you Even though you’re on the other side of the world When you wake up I go to bed But I know that you’ll come home again Come home again Ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, oh I will take care of you Even though you’re on the other side of the world When you wake up I go to bed But I know that you’ll come home again You and the skyline of Shanghai I’m waiting for mountains high I know we’re far away I know we’re far away But you will forever stay my best friend
