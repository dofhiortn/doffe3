title: Stuffed Animals
---

"I used to be afraid of the knifeman under my bed But now I know, that was only some creeps inside my head I’m still disgust by ketchup, I think it’s the most terrible thing in the world Well, now I know that’s a bit odd so can you, please, keep me out of discussion? Take me down to my favorite place And leave me out of disgrace Take me down to your favorite place And let me out of this evil phase Nowadays I feel malaise for stuffed animals and for black seas Oily clouds raining in front of me, while walking on floating earth We’re all afraid of the blue anemone taking over S-S-Sweden The future is still a mystery, so please, show me your strawberry land Take me down to my favorite place And leave me out of disgrace Take me down to your favorite place And let me out of this evil Take me down, take me down to your favorite place Take me down, take me down to your strawberry land Take me down, take me down Take me down to my favorite place And leave me out of disgrace Take me down to your favorite place And let me out of this evil phase
